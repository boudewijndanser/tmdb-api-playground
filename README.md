### Description
I am a big movie fan and am just finding out how awesome API's are. To me they are a really nice way to get cool content/ data about lots of different subjects and give you the chance to play around with that data in your front-end.

The [API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) provived by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) gives me the opportunity to upgrade my JavaScript / React / Css / SASS skills while keeping the movie-nerd in me happy!

Sounds like a win-win, right?

### Wishlist
These are the things I want to practice /improve / try

#### React
- Lifting up state in React
- State & component lifecycle
- Improve my container / component stucture

#### JavaScript
- More DRY / Re-using functions
- Mapping through arrays & objects
- Promises / Await / Then

#### Styling
- Start with SASS
- Better structure / overview of CSS
- Responsive / use the whole screen on desktop
